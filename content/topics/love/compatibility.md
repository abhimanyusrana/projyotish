## Beyond Sun Signs

Western astrology tends to focus on sun sign compatibility, but Vedic astrology takes a far more detailed approach. The practice of **Kundali matching** (also known as Gun Milan or Ashtakoot) analyses 8 separate dimensions of compatibility between two people's charts.

## The 8 Kootas of Kundali Matching

Each koota carries a point value, and the total score out of 36 reveals the overall compatibility:

- **Varna** (spiritual compatibility) — 1 point
- **Vasya** (mutual attraction and control) — 2 points
- **Tara** (health and longevity of the relationship) — 3 points
- **Yoni** (physical and sexual compatibility) — 4 points
- **Graha Maitri** (mental compatibility and friendship) — 5 points
- **Gana** (temperament and nature) — 6 points
- **Bhakoot** (love, emotional connection, family welfare) — 7 points
- **Nadi** (health and progeny) — 8 points

A score of 18 or above is generally considered acceptable. 24+ is excellent.

## The 7th House: Your Partnership Zone

Beyond Kundali matching, a skilled Vedic astrologer examines the **7th house** in both charts — this is the house of partnership, marriage, and committed relationships. The sign on the 7th house cusp, its lord, and any planets placed within it reveal your relationship patterns and what you need in a partner.

## Venus: The Significator of Love

**Venus** is the primary indicator of love, beauty, and romantic desire in both charts. When one person's Venus aligns with the other's Ascendant, Moon, or Venus, there is a natural magnetism and appreciation.

## Important Caution

Compatibility scores are a starting point, not a verdict. Two people with a moderate score but strong mutual Venus contacts and a shared life vision often create more fulfilling relationships than a high-scoring match with difficult Saturn placements. Always seek a holistic reading.
