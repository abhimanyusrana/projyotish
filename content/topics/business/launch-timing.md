## Why Launch Timing Matters

In Vedic astrology, the moment a business begins — its "birth chart" — shapes its destiny. Just as a person's birth chart reveals their strengths and challenges, a business started at an auspicious moment carries that energy forward.

## Planets That Govern Business Success

**Jupiter** governs growth, abundance, and expansion. Starting a business during a Jupiter transit to your 1st, 2nd, or 10th house is ideal for ventures that require long-term trust and reputation.

**Mercury** rules trade, communication, and transactions. Strong Mercury placements are essential for businesses involving technology, media, education, or retail.

**The 2nd house** (wealth accumulation) and **11th house** (gains and networks) are the key houses to watch for business success.

## Key Muhurta Principles for Business Launches

1. **Avoid retrograde Mercury** — contracts, launches, and negotiations undertaken during Mercury retrograde often face unexpected reversals
2. **Choose a waxing Moon** — the first two weeks after a new Moon carry a building, expansive energy
3. **Favour Thursday or Wednesday** — Jupiter's and Mercury's days respectively, ideal for business beginnings
4. **Ascendant and Moon should be in strong signs** — Taurus, Cancer, Leo, and Libra are generally favourable rising signs for business

## Practical Steps

- Get your personal birth chart assessed alongside the planned launch date
- Identify your natal Jupiter's current transit — is it supporting your 10th house (public reputation) or 2nd house (cash flow)?
- Consult your astrologer for a precise muhurta that accounts for your specific chart and the nature of your business
