## The Astrological Roots of Stress

In Vedic astrology, stress and anxiety are often linked to the **Moon** (mind and emotions), **Mercury** (nervous system), and the **6th house** (health challenges and obstacles). When these are afflicted — by Rahu, Saturn, or malefic aspects — mental agitation increases.

## Key Planets That Affect Mental Peace

**The Moon** governs your emotional baseline. A strong, unafflicted Moon in your chart is one of the greatest protections against chronic anxiety. When the Moon transits challenging nakshatras or receives Saturn's aspect, emotional turbulence rises.

**Rahu and Ketu** can create an unsettled, restless quality to the mind — especially during their Mahadasha periods. The mind races, sleep suffers, and a sense of purpose feels distant.

**Saturn's influence on the Ascendant or Moon** can bring prolonged periods of mental heaviness, particularly during Sade Sati (the 7.5-year Saturn transit over the natal Moon).

## Remedies and Timing

- **Moon remedies**: Pearl gemstone (consult your astrologer), fasting on Mondays, and chanting the Chandra mantra at moonrise
- **Rahu remedies**: Hessonite gemstone for those with strong Rahu, meditation, avoiding stimulants during Rahu kaal
- **Timing recovery**: Jupiter transits over your natal Moon are windows for genuine mental restoration — these are powerful periods for therapy, meditation retreats, and lifestyle changes

## A Holistic Approach

Vedic astrology never replaces professional mental health support. It is a lens for understanding patterns and choosing *when* and *how* to act. Your chart can reveal which areas of life are causing the most depletion — and which remedies are most aligned to your specific constitution.
