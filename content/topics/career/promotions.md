## Why Timing Your Promotion Request Matters

In Vedic astrology, career growth is governed primarily by the **10th house** (the house of profession and status) and the planets Jupiter and Saturn. When these planets align favourably in your chart, opportunities for advancement naturally open up — and asking at the right moment can be the difference between a yes and a "maybe later."

## Key Planetary Transits to Watch

**Jupiter transits** are the most auspicious for career advancement. When Jupiter transits your 10th house, 1st house, or aspects your natal Sun or Moon, you're in a period of expansion. Promotions requested during Jupiter periods tend to stick — they come with genuine recognition, not just a title change.

**Saturn, the taskmaster**, governs long-term career structure. A Saturn return (around ages 28–30 and 58–60) is a major restructuring period. Rather than avoiding it, use it to demonstrate sustained commitment — organisations notice loyalty during challenging times.

**The 10th Lord's period (Dasha)** is perhaps the most reliable indicator. Running the Mahadasha or Antardasha of your 10th house lord is often when your career reaches its peak visibility.

## Practical Steps Rooted in Astrology

1. **Get your natal chart read** — identify your 10th lord and its current transit position
2. **Note Jupiter and Saturn transits** — plan your conversation during supportive windows
3. **Avoid retrograde Mercury** for formal negotiations — communication tends to go awry
4. **Muhurta (auspicious timing)** — for formally applying or having the conversation, choose a day with a strong Moon (waxing phase, Monday or Thursday)

## A Note on Karma and Effort

Vedic astrology never replaces preparation. Your chart shows the *windows* — your skills and track record are what you step through them with. The planets amplify what you've already built.
