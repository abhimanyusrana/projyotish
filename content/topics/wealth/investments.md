## Wealth in the Birth Chart

In Vedic astrology, financial prosperity is primarily assessed through the **2nd house** (accumulated wealth and savings), the **11th house** (gains, income, and financial networks), and the **Dhana Yogas** — special planetary combinations that indicate wealth-creating potential.

## Jupiter: The Greatest Wealth Indicator

**Jupiter** is the planet of abundance, growth, and fortune. When Jupiter transits your 2nd house, 5th house (speculation and investments), or 11th house, the conditions for financial growth are most favourable. These are the ideal windows to make significant investment decisions.

## Saturn: Discipline and Long-term Wealth

**Saturn** governs long-term structures and disciplined wealth accumulation. A strong Saturn in the natal chart often indicates steady, patient wealth building — the kind that comes from consistent effort rather than windfalls. During Saturn's Mahadasha, focus on secure, long-term investments over speculative ones.

## Periods to Exercise Caution

- **Rahu Mahadasha** can create sudden gains but also sudden reversals — high-risk ventures feel tempting but often don't deliver
- **12th house transits** by major planets are associated with expenses and losses — a natural time to consolidate rather than expand
- **Mercury retrograde** is not ideal for signing investment contracts or making major financial commitments

## Practical Guidance

1. Identify your **Dhana Yoga** combinations — your astrologer can tell you which planetary periods are most likely to activate wealth
2. Watch **Jupiter and Saturn transits** to your 2nd and 11th houses — these are your key wealth windows
3. For speculative investments, assess the **5th house** and its lord's strength in current transits
4. Avoid major financial decisions during your **Sade Sati** period unless your chart shows strong natural wealth combinations
